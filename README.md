# Library Management System (LMS)

## Objective
Develop a Java-based application to manage the operations of a library. This system will handle book checkouts, returns, track inventory, and maintain user data.

## Core Requirements

### Entities
- **Book**: 
  - Attributes: *title, author, ISBN, number of copies, etc.*
- **User**: 
  - Attributes: *name, user ID, borrowed books, etc.*

### Functionalities
1. Add, delete, and modify book details.
2. Register, delete, and modify user details.
3. Borrow a book. If the book isn't available, users should be added to a waitlist.
4. Return a book.
5. Display all the books in the library.
6. Display all the users of the library.
7. Save and load library data using file I/O.

### Console-Based UI
1. Create a main menu to navigate through different functionalities.
2. Input validation: Ensure only valid data is entered.

## Advanced Extension Requirements

### Database Integration
1. Replace file I/O with a relational database system like MySQL or SQLite.
2. Implement JDBC to connect, retrieve, and modify the database.

### Graphical User Interface
1. Create a GUI using JavaFX or Swing.
2. Implement features like drag-and-drop for book borrowing.

### User Authentication
1. Implement a login system for users and admins.
2. Passwords should be hashed and stored securely.
3. Role-based access control: Differentiate between normal users and admin.

### Search and Filter Options
1. Allow users to search for books based on various criteria (e.g., title, author, ISBN).
2. Implement filters like 'available books', 'borrowed books', etc.

### Reports and Analytics
1. Create a reporting module where admins can generate reports about most borrowed books, active users, etc.
2. Implement simple data visualization (e.g., pie charts or bar graphs).

### API Integration
1. Integrate with an external book database API (e.g., Open Library API) to fetch and display book details.
2. If a book isn't in the library, provide an option to suggest the addition of the book based on the external API data.

### Advanced OOP Concepts
1. Use design patterns such as Singleton for the database connection, Strategy for different searching algorithms, and Observer for the waitlist mechanism.
2. Implement multi-threading to handle simultaneous book checkouts or data fetches from the API.

### Unit Testing
1. Use JUnit to write test cases for your application.
2. Aim for high code coverage and incorporate mock objects using libraries like Mockito.

**Note**: Start with the core requirements to refresh your basic Java skills. Once you're comfortable, progressively tackle the advanced extension requirements. This approach will ensure you cover a wide range of Java concepts, both fundamental and advanced. Happy coding!
